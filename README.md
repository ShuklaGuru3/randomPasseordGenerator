This project generates a customised random passowrd based on four input parameters i.e, Including Upper case letter,Lower case letter, a numerical digit
and a symbol.
The password is shuffled using the Fisher Yates method inorder to keep it randomized.
It also displays the strength of the password generated using three criterias i.e,
"RED" for it being weak --> when only one or two out of the four are ticked
"Yellow" suggesting moderate --> when 3/4 are ticked
and
"Green" suggesting a strengthy password --> when all four of them are ticked.
